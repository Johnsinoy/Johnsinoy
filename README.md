Hey there! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

A little about me:
🎓 Currently studying Computer Programming at Red Deer Polytechnic—already have a Bachelor’s in Electronics Engineering

🌱 Always learning—right now, diving into ASP.NET, Node.js, Spring Boot, and front-end magic

👯 Open to collaborations, especially in web development and tech solutions

🤔 Need help? Let’s troubleshoot together!

💬 Ask me about programming, databases, or even night audit hacks

📫 Reach me at [jcsinoy91@gmail.com]

⚡ Fun fact: I can probably debug your code faster than I can decide what to eat for lunch 🍕🤔
